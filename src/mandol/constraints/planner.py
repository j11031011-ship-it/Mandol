"""Constraint-aware planner for constrained hybrid retrieval.

The planner is the coordination layer requested by the assignment: it resolves
every declared constraint into a ``CandidateSet``, intersects the sets (AND
semantics), and drives ``MultiRetriever.smart_search`` with the resulting
execution plan. Selectivity decides how the candidate set reaches retrieval:
sets covering less than the configured fraction of the corpus are pushed down
as the ``candidate_uids`` pre-filter, while broad sets are applied to fused
results afterwards (post-filter). The post-filter pool then scales with
selectivity so ``top_k`` can still be filled, and a configurable
``FallbackPolicy`` decides what happens when the intersection is degenerate.
