"""Constraint resolvers: leaf predicates evaluated into candidate sets.

Every resolver answers the same question — "which UIDs satisfy this leaf
constraint?" — so the planner can combine them with set algebra without knowing
how each predicate is evaluated. Metadata and time predicates consult the
per-field indexes registered on ``SemanticMap`` (P1) and fall back to the
linear-scan implementation whenever a field or operator is not servable; the
graph BFS resolver (P2) walks ``SemanticGraph.rx_graph`` directly. All of them
share the same ``BaseConstraintResolver.resolve`` contract, so the planner and
the retrieval backends stay unaware of how a predicate is evaluated.
